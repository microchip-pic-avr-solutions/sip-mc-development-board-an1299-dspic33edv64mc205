; ReadADC0 and ReadSignedADC0
;
;Description:
;  Read Channel 0 of ADC, scale it using qK and put results in qADValue.
;  Do not call this routine until conversion is completed.
;
;  ReadADC0 range is qK*(0.0 ->0.9999).
;  ReadSignedADC0 range is qK*(-1.0 ->0.9999).
;
;  Scaling constant, qK, must be set elsewhere such that
;         iResult = 2 * qK * ADCBUF0
;  The factor of 2 is designed to allow qK to be given in 1.15.
;
;
;Function prototype:
; Calculates unsigned value 0 -> 2*qK
; void ReadADC0( int16_t ADC_Result,READ_ADC_PARM_T* pParm )
; Calculates signed value -2*qK -> 2*qK
; void ReadSignedADC0( int16_t ADC_Result,READ_ADC_PARM_T* pParm )
;
;On Entry:   ReadADCParm structure must contain qK. ADC channel 0
;            must contain signed fractional value.
;
;On Exit:    ReadADCParm will contain qADValue
;
;Parameters:
; Input arguments: None
;
; Return:
;   Void
;
; SFR Settings required:
;         CORCON.SATA  = 0
;     If there is any chance that Accumulator will overflow must set
;         CORCON.SATDW = 1
;
; Support routines required: None
;
; Local Stack usage: None
;
; Registers modified: w0,w4,w5
;
; Timing: 13 cycles
